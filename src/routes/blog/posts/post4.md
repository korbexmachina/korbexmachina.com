# <Header>Post 4 - Spring Quarter</Header>

Wow, it's been almost a month since my last post! The first week of spring quarter is almost over, and I have officially begun my final lower deivision declaration requirement. I can't wait to start taking my upper division classes in the fall!

I'm currently working with my friend Zephiris on a Svelte plugin for SvelteHack, as well as preparing for the ForAllSecure Mayhem Hackathon at UCSC.

Just a quick update for now, I'm hoping to post here a little more regularly though.
